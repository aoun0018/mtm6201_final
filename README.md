## Processe

### UxUI:
- **Personas** -  Creating many different personas to see different targeted audiences and deciding which group you would want your website to cater to more.
- **Sitemaps** - Mapped out the entire website structure and picking 3 pages to develope.
- **Mood Board and Style Tiles** - Created a collective visual of images and style for the Moodboard and picked out different colour buttons and font styles for the StyleTile.
- **Wireframe** - Created a low-fidelity wireframe to establish the general layout of each page and, after feedback, developed them into high fidelity.
- **Prototype** - Created a Interactive protorype


## Challenges:
- Being the first time I used Bootstrap and coded a multiple-page website, I was faced with many challenges. Having to learn Bootstrap and use its elements was very challenging at first, but after messing around with it, it became very easy and useful. I understand why Bootstrap is praised so highly in the coding community. I did have a problem with the images changing layouts properly, and it took me quite some time and research to figure out how to overcome this problem and that I can add the same image twice and hide one of them at different breakpoints. I also realized that a lot of websites use this technique.

## What I learnt:
- I learned how useful Bootstrap is and understand that if you can get good at it, you can code websites very quickly. I also learned that it is really important to keep your code clean and organized and also how important CSS classes are. When I first started this project, I didn't use any of them and was styling each individual section on its own. Later realizing that I could use CSS classes made my experience a lot easier. I tried using them as much as I could, but I still think I missed out on some parts.

## Assets and Resources

### Libraries and Frameworks:
- **Bootstrap 5** – For layout,responsive grid system and navigation.
- **Hover.css** – For adding hover effects and animations.

- **Emojis** All Emojis used in the contact section are Unicode standard these emojis are free to use as they are part of the Unicode character set.

### Tools:
- **Figma** – Used for designing wireframes and mockups.
- **Chat GPT** - AI tools were used and allowed in the UX/UI creation of the project for writing content in the prototype and high fidelity wireframes.
